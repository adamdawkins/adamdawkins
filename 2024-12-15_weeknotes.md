# Weeknotes for 2024 Week 50

I spoke at LRUG on Monday on Saving my Relationship With Rails, with a Functional Domain in a Rails Web App. It went well; it's the first tech talk I've done, and I definitely  got more confident the more I got into saying things I believe in. The weirdest part was that when people came to speak to me afterwards, they didn't introduce themselves. I realised that was because they already knew my name!

Before going, I went inside the Barbican Centre for the first time, and -- wow -- what a building. 

## Coding 
Work's still very busy, we have some key things to release in the run up to Christmas, so next week will be full on. I really enjoyed reading this article from Kelly Sutton about [private Active Record models](https://kellysutton.com/2019/10/29/taming-large-rails-codebases-with-private-activerecord-models.html). The related talk, [Taming Monoliths  Without Microservices](https://youtu.be/-ovkkvvTiRM?si=WjCnC1VJdxUQY_jn) was also excellent, and solidified a few ideas for a way forward in some of our larger apps in my head. 

I can't get my head around Gusto at the time of the talk having a 1.5 million lines of code, 100 developers monolith. An order of magnitude above our largest app, and we're already feeling the pinch.

## Reading & Watching

Didn't make much progress on any reading this week, but I watched [Union with David Olusoga](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0gd25kn/union-with-david-olusoga), which was excellent. I was surprised by how recently Britain was one of the most equal countries in Europe, and that trend [didn't start reversing until 1983](https://www.poverty.ac.uk/editorial/more-unequal-country).

I watched [Fly Me To The Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1896747/), gave it a generous 6/10.

Chat GPT roasted me, and it was pretty on the nose. The fun part of the exercise was realising that getting offended by Chat GPT was so absurd that, by extension, it's also quite absurd to get offended by things other people might say too. 

## Other

I'm behind on Christmas shopping. Really behind. I keep getting to it on my list but I want to find the headspace to put more thought into it than 'just buying some stuff'.
