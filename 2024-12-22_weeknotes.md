# Weeknotes for 2024 Week 51

A busy week, probably a little _too_ busy for the time of year; but we took on a few large features for a client for the end of the year. We've got some of the bigger pieces out, and a lot of the others are ready, but I don't have the appetite to deploy them days before everbody's off for Christmas. Hopefully it allows us to start the new year strong.

## Coding 

Been incredibly frustrated with the 'CSSification' of some of the code in our projects. What I mean by this, is in the old days of CSS, to get your change in, you'd just add it to the bottom of a file, because CSS cascades, and half the time it was the only way to make the thing change colour (this was before BEM and it's Tailwind descendent stopped the specificity stack being such an issue.).

What it's lead to is me trying to add pretty trivial code to classes that have been written in such a way that to either test them properly, or add what I want properly, isn't doable. 

I've been applying Kent Beck's infamous maxim:

> Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change. -- Kent Beck

But it's not ideal in late December.

It might serve for some internal sessions on keeping classes "Open to Extension" where we can. Not sure.

## Reading & Watching

- Watched Dune parts 1 and 2; large-world sci-fi epics really aren't my thing, but I enjoyed it. In many ways, probably a better story than Star Wars (there, I said it). Both scored an 8/10.

## Christmas

Time for a change of pace.
